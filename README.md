# skope-elasticsearch

This repo contains scripts, tests, and other resources supporting development of the Elasticsearch service component of the SKOPE system.  It allows ES to be run independently of the other SKOPE services, provides scripts for loading the ES instance with data, and includes a framework for automatically testing each of the searches we support through the SKOPE user interface.
