# SW USA 2000 Year Growing Degree Days and Precipitation Reconstructions

Humans experience, adapt to and influence climate at local scales. Paleoclimate
research, however, tends to focus on continental, hemispheric or global scales,
making it difficult for archaeologists and paleoecologists to study local 
effects. Here we introduce a method for high-frequency, local climate-field 
reconstruction from tree-rings. We reconstruct the rain-fed maize agricultural 
niche in two regions of the southwestern United States with dense populations of
prehispanic farmers.
