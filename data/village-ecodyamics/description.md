# Village Ecodynamics Project Settlement
This is the Village Ecodynamics Project settlement model version 5.4, 
which was reported in:

Kohler, Timothy A. and Mark D. Varien, eds. 2012. Emergence and Collapse 
of Early Villages: Models of Central Mesa Verde Archaeology. University
of California Press, Berkeley, California.

The method combines survey data, ceramics, and tree-ring dates—among 
other indicators—to estimate the population (in households) of over 4000 
archaeological sites in a 1700 square kilometer area of southwestern 
Colorado, United States.
